# Design

## Theme

The main theme of this app is going to be playful, but still the app is going to look and feel clean and professional.

## Color scheme

We have created the color theme according to the theme and the targeted group using the app.

## Hierarchy and layout

The most important functionality of the app is the ability to book gaming stations.

- Easy to find and book a gaming station at a specific date and time.
- Be able to find general information about membership and the different gaming stations.

## Images


## Icons

The icons color should follow the [color theme](#color-scheme).

## Typography

We will be using Myriad Pro as it is the official font of the Red Cross, and we think it is a good font to represent our ides and values.

We will be using Bold font for titles hand headlines. and thin/regular for the paragraphs.

## Border rounding

## Shadows
