# Design

## Theme

The main theme of the site is going to be a serious design, since the site is a professional business fighting for a important and serious caus.

......

## Color scheme

We have created the colour theme according to the RedCross foundation's visual

## Hierarchy and layout

The most important product of the pages is to sell the course. To to this the page needs to build trust. the page will do this by:

- Having a professional look and feel
- Easy to find courses and information about the courses
- Building trust by showing experience and reviews

## Images

Image text will be aside of the images. As it is easier to read, and creates a more professional look.
An exertion to this will bew the hero images on the landingpage.

Because of this we will for the most part be using clear images without a colour-overlay.

## Icons

We will be using the icon pack from [OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/story/iconography-part-un%E2%80%99s-humanitarian-efforts-ocha-releases-new-humanitarian-icons) since the Red Cross Foundation already is using it.

The icons colour should follow the [colour theme](#color-scheme).

## Typography

We will be using Myriad Pro as it is the official font of the Red Cross, and we think it is a good font to represent our ides and values.

We will be using Bold font for titles hand headlines. and thin/regular for the paragraphs.

## Border rounding

We will restrict the usage of border rounding to a minimum, as it creates a less serious look and feel of the site. But will be using it some places where we feel it will give a much nicer looking design.

## Shadows

We will restrict the usage of border rounding to a minimum, as it could creates a less serious look and feel of the site. But will be using it some places where we feel it will give a much nicer looking design.
