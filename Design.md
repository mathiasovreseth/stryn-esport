## Hierarchy and layout

The most important functionality of the app is the ability to book gaming stations.

- Easy to find and book a gaming station at a specific date and time.
- Be able to find general information about membership and the different gaming stations.

## Images


## Icons

The icons color should follow the [color theme](#color-scheme).

## Typography

The app will be using Roboto as the standard font. With font size 14 and font weight 400 as default. 

## Border rounding

In the app we will have rounded corners with a value of 10 on buttons and widgets. This will create a more playfull feel of the app
